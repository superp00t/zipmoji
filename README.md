# ZIPmoji

ZIPmoji is a simple Web library for adding web-support for emojis, without making a new HTTP request every time a different Emoji is used.

This is not very useful if you don't care about generating a lot of HTTP requests, in which case, it is probably more prudent to use [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/).

```js
const ZIPmoji = require("zipmoji");

var zm = new ZIPmoji();

var html = zm.process("ðŸ™Œ");
  // <img alt="ðŸ™Œ" draggable="false" class="zipmoji" src="blob:..."></img>

document.body.innerHTML += html;
```
